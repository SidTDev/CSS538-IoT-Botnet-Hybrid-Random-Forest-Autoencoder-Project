# CSS538 IoT Botnet Hybrid Random Forest Autoencoder Project
 This study addresses the critical challenge of distinguishing between Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in Internet of Things (IoT) networks through a novel hybrid machine learning approach. While existing intrusion detection systems typically focus on binary classification of normal versus malicious traffic, this research proposes that attack-specific classification can significantly improve incident response and mitigation strategies. By combining autoencoder-based feature extraction with Random Forest classification, we aim to achieve superior classification accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for IoT environments. The study utilizes the Bot-IoT dataset's 10-feature subset, leveraging modern GPU acceleration for model training and validation.
